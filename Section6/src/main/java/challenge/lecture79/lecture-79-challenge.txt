        // Create a new class VipCustomer
        // it should have 3 fields name, credit limit, and email address.
        // create 3 constructors
        // 1st constructor empty should call the constructor with 3 parameters with default values
        // 2nd constructor should pass on the 2 values it receives and add a default value for the 3rd
        // 3rd constructor should save all fields.
        // create getters only for this using code generation of intellij as setters wont be needed
        // test and confirm it works.
