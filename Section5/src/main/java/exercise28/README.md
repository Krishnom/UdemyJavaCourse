You have to write a program that helps Bob calculate how many buckets of paint he needs to buy before going to work. Bob might also have some extra buckets at home. He also knows the area that he can cover with one bucket of paint.</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Write a method named <strong>getBucketCount </strong>with 4 parameters. The f<strong>irst </strong>parameter should be named <strong>width</strong> of type <strong>double.</strong> This parameter represents the <strong>width</strong> of the wall.</p><p>The <strong>second</strong> parameter should be named <strong>height</strong> of type <strong>double.</strong> This parameter represents the <strong>height</strong> of the wall.</p><p>The <strong>third</strong> parameter should be named <strong>areaPerBucket. </strong>This parameter represents the area that can be covered with one bucket of paint.</p><p>The <strong>fourth</strong> parameter should be named <strong>extraBuckets. </strong>This parameter represents the bucket count that Bob has at home.</p><p>The method needs to return a value of type <strong>int </strong>that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.</p><p>If one of the parameters <strong>width, height or areaPerBucket</strong> <strong>is less or equal to 0</strong> <strong>or if extraBuckets</strong> is <strong>less than 0, </strong>the method needs to <strong>return -1</strong> to indicate an invalid value.</p><p>If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and <strong>return</strong> it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of input/output:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2);</strong></code><strong> </strong>→ should <strong>return -1 </strong>since the width parameter is invalid</p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2);</strong></code> → should <strong>return 3 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>7.14</strong>, a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>1.5</strong> and Bob has 2 extra buckets home.</p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(2.75, 3.25, 2.5, 1); </strong></code>→ should <strong>return 3 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>8.9375, a </strong>single bucket can cover an area of <strong>2.5</strong> and Bob has 1 extra bucket at home.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. </strong>Bob does not like to enter 0 for the <strong>extraBuckets</strong> parameter so he needs another method.</p><p>Write another overloaded method named <strong>getBucketCount </strong>with 3 parameters namely <strong>width, height, and areaPerBucket</strong> (all of type <strong>double</strong>).</p><p>This method needs to return a value of type <strong>int </strong>that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.</p><p>If one of the parameters <strong>width, height or areaPerBucket</strong> <strong>is less or equal to 0, </strong>the method needs to <strong>return -1</strong> to indicate an invalid value.</p><p>If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and <strong>return</strong> it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of input/output:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5);</strong></code><strong> </strong>→ should <strong>return -1 </strong>since the <strong>width</strong> parameter is invalid</p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5);</strong></code> → should <strong>return 5 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>7.14</strong>, and a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>1.5.</strong></p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(7.25, 4.3, 2.35);</strong></code><strong> </strong>→ should <strong>return 14 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>31.175, </strong>and a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>2.35</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>3. </strong>In some cases, Bob does not know the width and height of the wall but he knows the area of a wall. He needs you to write another method.</p><p>Write another overloaded method named <strong>getBucketCount </strong>with 2 parameters namely, <strong>area and areaPerBucket</strong> (both of type <strong>double</strong>).</p><p>The method needs to return a value of type <strong>int </strong>that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.</p><p>If one of the parameters <strong>area </strong>or<strong> areaPerBucket</strong> <strong>is less or equal to 0, </strong>the<strong> </strong>method needs to <strong>return -1</strong>to indicate an invalid value.</p><p>If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and <strong>return</strong> it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of input/output:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(3.4, 1.5);</strong></code><strong> </strong>→ should <strong>return 3 </strong>since the area is <strong>3.4</strong> and a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>1.5</strong></p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(6.26, 2.2);</strong></code> → should <strong>return 3 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>6.26 </strong>and a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>2.2.</strong></p></li><li><p><code><strong>getBucketCount(3.26, 0.75);</strong></code><strong> </strong>→ should <strong>return 5 </strong>since the wall area is <strong>3.26, </strong>and a single bucket can cover an area of <strong>0.75</strong> .</p></li></ul><p>Do your best to help Bob&nbsp;<img src="https://intrinsicservices.atlassian.net/wiki/s/651512973/6452/f589e3052a893fe253bec21ae759306a9006039c/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png">.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: Use the method</strong> <strong>Math.ceil</strong> to round the number of calculated buckets <strong>(double)</strong> then convert it into an <strong>int</strong> before returning the value from the methods.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All <strong>​</strong>methods should be defined as<strong> public static </strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not add the <strong>main </strong>method to the solution code.</p></div></div><div class="instructions--drag-handle--ocDGT"></div>
